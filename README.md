**Overview**    

This project focuses on developing and training deep neural networks for image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely-used benchmark in the field of computer vision, providing a diverse and representative set of images across ten different categories. Our goal is to explore various neural network architectures, optimization methods, and regularization techniques to enhance model performance in categorizing images accurately.
